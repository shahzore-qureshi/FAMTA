# FAMTA (or MTA Fam)
## Introduction
The MTA subway lines just never seem to work on a consistent basis.
Construction, accidents, weather, and other factors can cause unexpected delays.
MTA can be very slow or inaccurate when reporting such delays.
Unfortunately, the poor citizens of NYC that use the subway suffer greatly.

FAMTA is a social network where the citizens of NYC can come together to help one another survive the MTA's incompetence.
If there is a delay on one of the subway lines, the folks affected can tweet out a warning to other FAMTA users.
If the MTA is wrong about certain delays, let's call them out and expose the truth.

FAMTA is not just a social network; it is a family. A FAM so to speak.
